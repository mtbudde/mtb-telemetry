# mtb-telemetry
A small mountain bike telemetry system based around a dsPIC microcontroller


12.1.17 - Current plan involves a yet-undecided dsPIC microcontroller, 9-DOF IMU system, SD card for data storage,and altimeter/barometer for various other sensing. Suspension travel telemetry is also a goal, however, a simple to attach and non-permanent option hasn't been determined yet. This project is a bit of a way for me to get more comfortable with complex embedded programming.
